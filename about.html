      Here's what you need to know about Pat -- Pat is a native from the PNW and he loves fish ! They are a good source of omega-3
      and are considered brain food. Pat also looooooooves cookies -- but he realized that most cookies are full of carbs
      and don't have a lot of protein. In 2005, Pat decided to change the cookie landscape in the Seattle area and he opened
      Salmon Cookies. The cookies are delicious and you can't even taste the fish ! Protein and pastries ? WIN !
